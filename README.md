1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)
This assignment took me somewhere around 11 hours to complete.
2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)
I used my past work, as well as the same rescources used as before, like the teaching websites and the class recordings/practice work.
3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)
I did not need to ask any friends.
4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?
I did not need to talk to any instructors.
5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
I can easily say that this was a harder assignment compared to the last one, mainly due to the scale of the final question. I am moderately confident in my ability to do something like this again.
